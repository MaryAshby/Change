<h1>Representing Changes in Data <i>Accurately</i></h1>
<p>
  What is the fundamental difference between the data discussed in chapter 7 and the data discussed in chapter 8?
  </p>
  <p>
    The discussion on data in chapter seven of Cairo's book, <u>The Truthful Art</u>, is on how to represent the distribution of data points. 
    The discussion on data in chapter eight of the book surrounds time based changes in that data. 
    For example, the data expressed in my Stressors vs Guiness chart shows beers consumed as related to various stressors at a single point in time.
    Examining the stress elements and associated beers consumed and how it changes over time tells a story about change.
