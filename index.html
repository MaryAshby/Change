<h1>Representing Changes in Data <i>Accurately</i></h1>
<p>
  What is the fundamental difference between the data discussed in chapter 7 and the data discussed in chapter 8?
  </p>
  <p>
    The discussion on data in chapter seven of Cairo's book, <u>The Truthful Art</u>, is on how to represent the distribution of data points. 
    The discussion on data in chapter eight of the book surrounds time based changes in that data. 
    For example, the data expressed in my Stressors vs Guiness chart shows beers consumed as related to various stressors at a single point in time.
    Examining the stress elements and associated beers consumed and how it changes over time tells a story about change.

2) What are the pro's and cons of 3 visualizations techniques discussed in chapter 8?
  </p>
  <p>
    <h3>Features of a Time Series</h3>
      A time series is a visualization that shows change over equally spaced time intervals on the x-axis and the 
variables on the y-axis (Cairo, p. 201).
  
   <ul>
     <li> Trend - how do the variables change in time?</li>
     <li> Seasonality - are there consistent and periodic fluctuations? </li>
     <li>Noise - are there random changes?</li>
  </ul>
The three types of visualizations Cairo writes about in Chapter eight are: indexes, ratios, and logs. These various time based series 
help to tease out the trends and seasonal changes, and smooth out noise.
      </p>
  <p>
  <h3>Features of an Index</h3>
  Indexing a time based chart will show the percentage of change over time. It is tied to a single index value or the average 
  of several values (Cairo, p. 214). It is useful for representing relative change. It is limited by its tether to one value.
  
  </p>
<p>
  <h3>Features of Ratio Charts</h3>
  A ratio time series allows comparison of the "rate of change of each time period in comparison to the previous one" (p. 214).
It can show changes that might get smoothed over in other time based charts, however, it is not good for for examining longer trends
in the data, as it the chage rate is based on the new period divided by the old.
</p>  
<p>
<h3>Features of a Logarithmic Scale</h3>
When looking at data that increases exponentially, the other time series charts may not visually represent the series well. 
Using a log base, the data points are set by their magnitude in relation to the previous point. It would not be useful
in instances with small increments of change.

  <i>In the beginning, at the time of the great flood, Noah went thru his ark after it landed, 
    and found two small snakes huddled in a corner. Noah looked at these poor specimens - and said 
    "I told you to go forth and multiply - why haven't you?"
The poor snakes looked up at Noah and replied "We can't because we are adders....."
Noah looked a bit perplexed, and then proceeded to tear bits of planking from his ark. 
    He went on to build a beautiful wooden platform. He gathered up the snakes and placed them on the platform,
    and joyfully told the snakes - "Now go forth and multiply, because even adders can multiply on a log table"</i>
